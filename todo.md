# 46-Tooth Chainring Detection Implementation

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Review current code structure
- [x] Identify chainring usage locations
- [x] Plan implementation approach

## Core Implementation
- [ ] Modify bike specifications to support multiple chainrings
- [ ] Update gear estimation algorithm for chainring detection
- [ ] Enhance cog estimation to determine chainring usage
- [ ] Update power calculations to use detected chainring
- [ ] Modify reporting to show detected chainring

## Missing Methods Implementation
- [ ] Implement download_all_workouts method
- [ ] Implement reanalyze_all_workouts method
- [ ] Implement estimate_cog_from_cadence method
- [ ] Implement get_user_cog_confirmation method
- [ ] Fix chart generation issue

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test with 38T chainring data
- [ ] Test with 46T chainring data
- [ ] Verify power calculations accuracy
- [ ] Validate report generation

## Code Quality
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Add logging for chainring detection
